<p>Found an issue with the site? Great! Please <a href="https://github.com/mstrutt/jekyll-portfolio/issues/new">open an issue on GitHub</a> and I'll do my best to fix it as soon as possible. If you're feeling <em>really</em> charitable, you could even put together a pull request (I do love how the open source community can help me correct my spelling) and I'll be indebted to you / owe you a pint.</p>
