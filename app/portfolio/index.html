			<h2 class="title">Orderable</h2>
			<p>Soon to be going into a closed alpha trial, Orderable is a marketplace that connects independent retails to the suppliers they user every day, streamlining their ordering experience. The application is written in AngularJS and consumes a series of RESTful JSON APIs.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Big Wednesday IO</h2>
			<p>We wanted the content to be easily editable via markdown, and everything to be deployed to static file hosting for optimal speed. To achieve this I used the Wintersmith static site generator, with the nunjucks templating plugin. Most of the site has been hand-coded.</p>

	<p>Some of the things I work on in my spare time</p>

		<div class="info">
			<h2 class="title">Weird Breakpoints</h2>
			<p>The idea for weird breakpoints was to break away from the 320/768/960 testing blinkers, and see your website in a viewport you might not have considered. I then extended this to use analytics data to show popular screen sizes from the last few months. Ironically, the site itself works best on larger screens.</p>

	<p>Below is a sample of some of the projects that I have worked on during my time at MICROS eCommerce.</p>

		<div class="info">
			<h2 class="title">Thorntons</h2>
			<p>For the Thornton's website we were working with a different platform from usual. There was a lot of work to get the code from the back-end ready for front-end styling. The deadline was very tight but I feel we did very well under the circumstances. The main areas I worked on are 'Checkout' and 'My Account'.</p>

		<div class="info">
			<h2 class="title">Taylor Walker</h2>
			<p>Taylor Walker is one of the white label sites based on the <a href="#chefandbrewer">Chef &amp; Brewer website</a>. I was part of a small team redoing all of the CSS and in some parts HTML to give apply a Taylor Walker look and feel to the website.</p>

		<div class="info">
			<h2 class="title">MICROS eCommerce Website</h2>
			<p>With the incorporation of Snow Valley into MICROS came the need for a rebranding and redesign of the company website. I lead a small team of contractors in this project to get the website from design to completion in just one week.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Virgin Atlantic Travel Money</h2>
			<p>The Virgin Atlantic Travel Money website is my favourite of the <a href="http://travelmoney.moneycorp.com/">Money Corp</a> white label sites that I worked on. The challenge was to implement the highly customised design using only CSS as the HTML was shared code, all with a very tight deadline.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Chef &amp; Brewer</h2>
			<p>This was the first of several <a href="/blog/2012/04/responsive-vs-adaptive">adaptive</a> websites we made for Spirit Pub Companies. I was involved from an early stage and coded significant amounts of the website. This was used as the basis for the white label sites that followed.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Ordnance Survey</h2>
			<p>On this site I styled a redesign of the homepage and extended that look and feel accorss the "Custom Made" maps section of the website. This included a dynamic feature showing preview text on the chosen map cover.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Sole Trader Mobile</h2>
			<p>This was the first soletradermobile build I worked on for MICROS eCommerce. Although there was an existing back end system, I rewrote almost all of the HTML and CSS to get the desired look and function of the mobile site. It was built with expansion in mind and scales well to medium sized devices.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Punch Buying Club</h2>
			<p>Punch is one of our largest clients, and there's always a series of enhancements being performed on the site in one way or another. I worked on several of these enhancements though as this is a members only site, it's not really something I can demonstrate.</p>

			<p>After receiving beautiful designs from <a href="http://dontwakemeup.com/">Kelly Dyson</a>, I built this site fully bespoke, including a custom CMS for the client to edit the website with. Clean, elegant, responsive.</p>
