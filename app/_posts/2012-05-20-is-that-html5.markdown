Is that HTML5? No, so stop asking. Seriously, do you even know what it is you are asking? When you say a strange blanket thing like that, you may as well be saying "is that an internet?"

HTML5 is 99% semantics, stuff going on behind the scenes, not a visual thing. Or would you prefer I give my answer based purely on the doctype of the page Im using? Dont get me wrong, I think HTML5 is great, a lot of the markup and speed benefits are really nice; but canvas aside, its stuff that the user doesnt see happening, they just benefit from it. Sadly its again the case of HTML5 is being used as a buzz-word. Being thrown around by people who want to sound like they know what theyre talking about.

"Is that CSS3?" would be a far more sensible thing to ask. While it is still a bit of a buzz-word, it is at least relevant. After all, CSS is presentational, and all the nice things you see like transitions, gradients, opacity and shadows *are* CSS3. Things you would have previously had to do with JavaScript now can be done purely in CSS, and to my mind, the results is much better.

Thats all I wanted to say on the matter, just please stop saying it. Dont make me resent the word for something that I love.
