After working at [Snow Valley](http://www.snowvalley.com/) for just over a month now, having learned vast amounts in such a short time, I thought it was about time I put my new skills to use on my own website.

MStrutt.co.uk is now fully HTML5 compliant taking advantage of all the lovely new features of CSS3 and all the -webkit extras. Soon I'll be adding in [HTML5 Microdata](http://schema.org/) and fully SEOptimise the site.

I see this happening many more times in the future as I continue to learn on the cutting edge of the web. Already this is filtering down into the other websites in my portfolio with a redesign of [ei8htyei8ht.com](http://ei8htyei8ht.com/) in progress, and [MSCycleBlog](http://cycleblog.mstrutt.co.uk/) & [HelpBuntu](http://helpbuntu.mstrutt.co.uk/) in the pipeline.
