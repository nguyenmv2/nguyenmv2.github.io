Good news. As part of a team of 6 we won the "[Accenture](http://www.accenture.com/) Team Project Prize for second year computing students December 2010". The months of hard work paid off and to the victors the spoils: Â£100 each.

The project was to redesign the system for submitting timetable requests at Loughborough University. We had to come up with an improvement for the current spreadsheet system, and then design and build a prototype of a fully interactive Website to replace the spreadsheet. To support this we had to come up with three detailed reports including Database diagrams and Use Case diagrams. Within the team my main roles were as Primary Web Developer and secondary Web Designer.

That's all for now, more updates to come soon no doubt.
