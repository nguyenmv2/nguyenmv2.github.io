## Browse the web like Xerces - The God King of the Persians - [Mike MacCana](https://twitter.com/mikemaccana)

- We are creatives, not consumers
- Shapeshifting wizards are real
- Chrome extensions have a separate set of globals to the page they're running on
- Event triggers can't work with event handlers in another world
- Crossing the worlds from extension to page, a script can find its URL and add a tag to itself to the page
- Soon chrome extensions will allow background apps to listen for keyboard shortcuts
	- Currently this has to be handled manually
- "When websites annoy me, I fix them. I'm a JavaScript Developer, I don't have to put up with crappy things"
- MutationSummary is an API to make things happen when the DOM changes - like conference tickets being available
- Web browsing tips
	- If something annoys you, change it
	- Automate the stuff that bores you

## Why is using typography on Web so difficult? - [Clare Evans](https://twitter.com/clare_lisbeth)

- InDesign vs HTML & CSS
- Old style numbers are more readable and can be achieved with opentype fonts
- `font-style-settings` open up a number of different options
- aliasing and hinting will give different text rendering options
- Hyphenation and justification is handled differently in browser
	- Can lead to "Snakes and Ladders"
	- Hyphenation options are coming (but no chrome support)
- "Where is the fun in web typography?"
	- CSS shapes for wrapping text around an image
	- Google fonts have some novelty font effects that can be added on

## Know Thy Interaction - [Ashley Nolan](https://twitter.com/AshNolan_)

- Web interaction used to be a lot more limited
- Interactions shouldn't get in the way of content
- Newer sites often have more cluttered content than sites with more focused and simpler use
- Good sites let the content do the talking
- Interaction design can really benefit from good content design
- Strip away the barriers between a user and the content / functionality
- Never underestimate simplicity
	- That said, visual complexity isn't always a bad thing
- Mapbox design principles
- The no swear test
	- If you get frustrated while using something, it fails
- Context is everything, and today it's very hard to assume
- Top codepens have some great examples of interactions
- Codedrops examples
- Effeckt.css
- New [Medium] posting experience
- How do we apply this to our work?
	- Macaw or Webflow
	- Facebook's origami
