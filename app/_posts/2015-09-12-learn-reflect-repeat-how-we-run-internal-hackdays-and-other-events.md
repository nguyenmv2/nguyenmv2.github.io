# Learn. Reflect. Repeat - How we run internal hackdays and other events - [Melinda Seckington](@mseckington)

> impostor syndrome: you're *not* the only one who feels like this

- impostor syndrome is caused by our assumptions about the world around us
- raise your hands if you've ever felt like this, and look around (most people raised hands)
- space and time to learn and fail

## How to create a culture of leaning

- two main causes
	- the way we act and work together
	- how we support learning

### The way we act and work together

- embrace failure
	- it's not something to be ashamed of
	- it's a part of learning
	- "If you aren't experiencing failure, then you are making a far worse mistake: you are being driven by the desire to avoid it" ~ Ed Catmull, Creativity, Inc.
- there are no stupid questions
	- google something if you don't know it
	- "Every question is a cry to understand the world" - Carl Sagan
- trust people to do the right thing
	- everyone in your team is working towards a common goal - trust that they know what to do, what they can and can't do
- treat people like grown ups
	- you shouldn't need to restrict people if you're trusting them
	- suggestion: don't require PRs, leave it up to the developer to decide if the code needs it
- don't think you can't do one thing, because your role if for another
- give *constructive* feedback

### How we support learning

- learn on your own
	- start a library
		- books
		- articles
		- blog posts
		- videos
	- take online courses
- learn from each other
	- pairing and collaboration
	- weekly learning hour
		- teach something you think others might find useful, it can be anything
	- give lightning talks
	- hackdays
		- get *everyone* involved
		- combine people wouldn't normally work together
	- share what you learn at conferences
	- invite external speakers
	- collaborate with other companies
- learn by teaching
	- write a blog post
	- give a talk
- take time to reflect
	- sprint retrospective
	- incident / project retrospective
	- personal retrospective
- repeat
	- there's no use just done something once. Keep doing it!

## Learn, reflect, repeat.
