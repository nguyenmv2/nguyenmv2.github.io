After being victorious in the first round, we took on-board our feedback, worked hard and we've done it again.

This time joint winners of the "[Detica](http://detica.com/) Team Project Prize for second year computing students May 2011".

The brief for the second part was to fully create the web-system that we had designed in the first part. Doing all of the server side scripting, the database management, the front-end development, the version control, and the project management entirely by ourselves.

The team worked very well together and did an incredible job against the stiff competition, coming joint first in what our tutors were calling the best overall results in years.

Long may it continue
