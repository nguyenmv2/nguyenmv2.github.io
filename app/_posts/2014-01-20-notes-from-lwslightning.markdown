## Architecting for success - [Daniel Knell](https://twitter.com/danielknell)
- Architect - primary deliverable is quality
	- Code
	- Process
	- Not losing quality over time
- Have to play with all the shiny stuff
- 5 step plan to better, lazier, more architectural thoughts
	- Communication
		- we suck at it
		- Stop thinking in terms of "us and them"
	- The Big Picture
		- Efficiency - minimise the amount of work that needs to be done
		- Build for reusability
	- Be Prepared
		- Build what is required now, but in a way that's prepared for what's likely to come next
	- Optimise: always
		- Be mindful of what you're optimising
		- Don't *just* focus on cost and speed
		- Developer Agility
	- Automation
		- Automate all the things
		- Grunt!
- Keep Learning!

## User Experience vs Learning Technology - [Leonard Houx](https://twitter.com/leonardhoux)
- Welcome to Academia
- Digital Natives
	- The internet generation have "brains full of internet"
- Constructivism
	- If you're gonna learn something, you have to learn it yourself
	- Create learning environment for the student
- Nice sentiments, but bad UX
- 'Digital Natives' “My butt!”
- Constructivism? "Also, my butt!"
- Cognitive Load
	- How much you can hold in short-term memory
- As UX leads to good teaching
	- Direct instruction
	- Worked Examples
	- Reduce Cognitive Load
- Accept your users
- Make learning *feel* better

## Mobile UX Patterns for eCommerce - [Fabio Bertone](https://twitter.com/fabiobeta)
- Don't just look at the "best" sites, look at the relevant ones
- Login / Register is the main pinpoint
	- Workout if user needs to login or register by analytics
	- Simplify registration
	- Accept there will be lots of registration errors, help the user out
	- Break it down into small steps with feedback loops
- Springboards are dead
- Different site behaviours for different user behaviours

## What is capability URL and why do I care? - [Daniel Appelquist](https://twitter.com/torgo)
- Cool URLs don't change, but not all URLs are cool
- No login required and easy to pass on
- URLs weren't designed to be secret
- Capability URLs Should:
	- only be https
	- expire
