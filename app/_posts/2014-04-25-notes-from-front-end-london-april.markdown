## The world keeps spinning round and round - [Arran Ross-Paterson](https://twitter.com/arranrp)

- Why are you here?
	- The adventure
	- [Get inspired and make stuff]
- If a senior developer doesn't learn anything for 5 years, they're a junior developer
- "You have to learn new skills to keep yourself in the same place"
- You don't need to be first, just soon, it puts you ahead of the game
- Ways to learn
	- Side projects are great
	- Go an make use of what you learn - get hands-on
- Help others learn
	- Talk through a problem with them
	- Chances are you know something that someone else doesn't

## Bridging the gap between developers and designers with Sass - [Kaelig Deloumeau-Prigent](https://twitter.com/kaelig)
- Releases 4x a day
	- Lots of iterations from feedback, can try lots out
- [Open Source](https://github.com/guardian/frontend)
- SASS is not just a development, it's a design tool and a great communication tool
- A careful Design System allows you to make decisions, not choices, when developing
- Reflect the toolbox in the design system so we all speak the same language
- Using variables, all colours and tone s can be named design-centric things
- [Media query abstractionn](https://github.com/guardian/sass-mq)
- Diagram with all of the Sass variables to explain the grid system
- Configure extra breakpoints to hook onto significant design changes, name them accordingly
- Matrix of human friendly font names mapping to what shows up for developers and designers

## Over promised and under delivered [Peter Gasston](@stopsatgreen)

- You ruined my holiday!
- File sizes are just getting worse and worse, it makes the web slow
- Mobile Web is rubbish
	- Web in general has it's problems, on mobile, it's exasperated
	- So many hurdles, I don't want your app!
	- Where is the content?
		- [brokenmobile.tumblr.com](http://brokenmobile.tumblr.com/)
		- [wtfmobileweb.com](http://wtfmobileweb.com/)
- We have a problem
	- Apps continue to dominate the mobile web
	- We need to pull our fingers out!
- Performance
	- We *need* to optimise
	- Progressive enhancement can make things feel way faster than they are
	- I do not care about
		- Retina photos
		- Typefaces
- Experiences
	- Don't be an arsehole
	- Stop jumping through hoops
	- viewport
		- minimal-ui - yes
		- user-scalable=no - NO
	- Correct input types
	- Don't reinvent the wheel, people expect certain patterns on a mobile
- Help is on its way
	- Picture element
	- Be considerate, don't ruin my battery and kill my data plan
	- ServiceWorker - "like Node.js for the browser" - and it's coming
- Bad performance is as bad as doing your whole site in Comic Sans
