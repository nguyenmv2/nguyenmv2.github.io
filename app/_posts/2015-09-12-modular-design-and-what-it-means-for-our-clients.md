# Modular Design and what it means for our clients - [Laura Elizabeth](@laurium)

- A set of components we build up to something like a pattern library
- move away from the classic linear process
	- PSD
	- sign off
	- build
	- deploy
- Pattern Lab & Front-end Style Guides

## what benefits can module design bring to our clients?

- "As we designers we craft experiences for users, but we often overlook the need to design the experience that clients have during the web design process"
- for a client
	- why?
	- how to sell it to them
	- deliverables
	- what's the business case?
	- assumes a working knowledge
	- to most clients, a website is just series of static pages, these are the deliverables they see

## Educating the client

- bring it up as early as possible
- useless if it's made once and never looked at again
- "applying the principles of modular design will save you time money and stress further down the line as your business grows"
- consider it an investment
- have a better working relationship
- website can get updated faster
- ability to update the website themselves better
- working collaboratively, needs to start with the language, not the interface
	- one of the biggest issues is a lack of shared vocabulary
	- try explaining it like LEGO
	- involve the clients in the naming process of your modules, let them pick things that make sense for them

# Process

- the practice of modular design isn't as simple and linear as it sounds at the start
- three key phase

### initial styling

- traditionally a mood board with swatches, samples etc
- the web very rarely uses this step
- style tiles, creating a nice visualisation of what the feel of the site is
	- clients like the multiple options and mix/match
	- it's a deliverable
	- they feel okay tearing apart something that doesn't look like a finished product
- get the client really involved

### planning

- think about the different modules that you might be using
- getting your ides down into something you can work with
- there's nothing wrong with using tools like Photoshop, or even sketching or straight to browser
- design a single page, the shell of the page gives context to the smaller modules
	- having the structure of the page can help you deconstruct it into modules
	- never show this page to the client, keep it internal, just for reference

### implementation

- work closely with design and development disciplines
- the more the client is involved in this, the better
- meetings need to be
	- more in depth
	- more practical
	- not necessarily more frequent
- common goal
	- per section
	- per template
	- per user flow
	- make the goal well known
- encourages more meaningful feedback
- designing patterns side-by-side with page templates, then show both to the client

## Key take aways

- think about the client's perspective
- show them the benefits relevant to them
- create a shared vocabulary
- provide a concrete process
- design side-by-side
