I am pleased to announce that I graduated from [Loughborough University](http://lboro.ac.uk/) with a 2:1 in Computer Science.

As a graduate I might expect to begin the long process of sending off countless CVs to dozens of companies. Instead, however, I am delighted to announce my return to [MICROS eCommerce](http://micros-ecommerce.com/) (formerly [Snowvalley](/blog/2011/07/starting-at-snow-valley)), who offered me a graduate job after I completed a successful and exciting professional placement with them.
	
I have now moved back into the London area, and will be taking full advantage of all the meetup opportunities, and be learning as much as I can. With this I plan to start blogging more frequently, and hope to keep to a fortnightly schedule (assuming I have learned something worth writing about).
