## Life behind the curve: [@westleyknight](https://twitter.com/westleyknight)

- [http://uptodate.frontendrescue.org/](http://uptodate.frontendrescue.org/)
- backlog takes way too long to go through
- bepressing: you can get threatened by the knowledge of others
	- pressure to learn
	- you don't have to feel this way
- it's time for someone else to do the hard work, accept that other people do and learn from their findings / fork their code
- "For after all, the best thing on can do when it's raining, is let it rain"
- 4 step approach
	- only learn what you need
	- keep it relevant (don't cram things in for the sake of it)
	- build an archive (useful things to search later)
	- take advice with a pinch of salt

## Node.js - what is and why do? [@adamyeats](https://twitter.com/adamyeats)

- JSis fun and works in lots of places
- "Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually written in JavaScript"
- can do front and backend with only one language
- "Asynchronicity"
- handles the event loop well by sticking and blocking i/o into a queue and carrying on
- NPMallows for simply requiring a module for something to work. Hugely reusable - "there's a module for that"
- super active community

## The internet is real anyway [@katskii](https://twitter.com/katskii)

- "It's not real life, it's only the internet" - No!
- UI!==UX
- moving away from just making internet things look like real life
- analytics is not a million miles away from people watching
- get to know your users "intimately" - then get to know your product better
- don't be afraid to question why you're doing something
- "If everything is important, then nothing is"
- Internet=Life

## Digital feudalism and how to avoid it [@aral](https://twitter.com/aral)

- our devices give us superpowers, they extend our biological abilities
- today we are cyborgs, we have technologies which extend our biological abilities
- "User experience is about control and focus" - if you control all of the elements, you control the user experience
- two individual elements can be great, but totally fail if nobody considers the experience as a whole
- when a new feature comes in, evaluate how it affects the experience as a whole
- "The age of features is dead, we are living in the age of experiences"
- [http://thelink.is/uxtalk/](http://thelink.is/uxtalk/)
- "Terms and Conditions may apply"
- if you're evaluating a new technology, live with it for a week
- design it not a democracy, it's about saying 'no', repeatedly
